# hiv-crispr-zscore-analysis

A lot of code to help Vanessa Montoya do data analysis for her research paper "HIV-CRISPR Screening to Identify Novel HIV-1 Dependency Factors"

_NOTE_: This branch contains code from Priyanka Roy [https://github.com/PriyankaRoy5/SARS-CoV-2-meta-analysis](https://github.com/PriyankaRoy5/SARS-CoV-2-meta-analysis).
Python was used to do z-score analysis. This code was not used in the final computations and in the paper, so was omitted from the `main`
branch. It is kept here for historical purposes.
